## Install

First create your site: `hugo new site <site_name>`

Then move into the directory: `cd <site_name>`

You can install using hugo's recommended theme install method while in your hugo site directory:

`git init`

`git submodule add https://github.com/deranjer/hugo-cookbook.git themes/cookbook`

OR

You can download the latest release, or the the current master as a zip, then extract the zip file into the themes directory.

## Copy Site Config

Then you can copy the `config.toml` from `exampleSite` to the root of your hugo directory, and modify that for your instance.

## Setup Default Template

Since hugo-cookbook is a single purpose theme, you need to override your default archetype so that all content created is of `recipe` type.

To override the default template, copy the `default.md` from `themes\archetypes\default.md` to `archetypes` and overwrite the current `default.md` in that directory.

This will ensure that any new content you create will be of type `recipe`.

## First Recipe

Simply run `hugo new recipe_name.md` to create your new recipe in the `content` folder.  Modify the markdown file as required for your new recipe.

`hugo serve` to view the site.
